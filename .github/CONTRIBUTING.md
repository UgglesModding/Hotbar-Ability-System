# Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch in your fork (`feature/my-change`)
3. Open a Pull Request

## Guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Use clear names
- Don’t commit built artifacts (`/build`, `/run`, `.jar` outputs)
- If you add assets, ensure paths match existing conventions

## Testing
Run:
- `./gradlew build`
- `./gradlew runServer` (if relevant)
